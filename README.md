# Peer to Peer game
This is a game idea I've had for a while, 
it's the idea to have a fully multiplayer game,
except all the players are connected through P2P and only a randevou server/save data store and user management.

## The game
The game is to be a 2D community driven, highly moddable game with a creative and also survival gameplay. 
Imagine it as sharing a minecraft server with friends, 
except you can easily share trusted mods with your friends and automatically increase the fun!

this section will be expanded once a concreate base for the game is established!
